**Proposed Event:** Get That Gold - This is an event geared to encouraging students to persevere in their faith walk while also enjoying an interactive scavenger hunt. 

**Intended Audience:** Grade 8-12

**Purpose of Event:** This event is timed to be near the end of January when semesters are changing and New Year's resolutions are dropping off. It encourages students to keeping running the race and to "go for the gold" or to obtain the prize that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 9:24.
