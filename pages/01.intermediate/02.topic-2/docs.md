**Proposed Event:** "Get That Gold" - This is an event geared to encouraging students to persevere in their faith walk. It will include a screen game, a message, small group time, and a scavenger hunt. And to ramp up the fun, there is a Llama theme throughout. 
(***This event is adapted from a Download Youth Ministry event package)

**Intended Audience:** Grade 8-12

**Purpose of Event:** This event is timed to be near the end of January when semesters are changing and New Year's resolutions are dropping off. It encourages students in regards to their faith to keeping running the race and to "go for the gold" or to obtain the prize that Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 9:24. The overall church's mission is to glorify God by making disciples of Jesus Christ, and this event supports that mission by encouraging students to keep going in their Christian life, and in the Christian disciplines they have already been taught earlier in the school year.

**Budget:** Approximately $300-$400

**Event Agenda** End of January; 7-9 pm Friday night (see Event Execution page for a detailed schedule)

**Rooms & Facilities Needed:** Youth Room for our main meeting; For the scavenger hunt: Sanctuary, Kitchen, Jr. Youth room, Office, and gym entrance area. 
(According the Church calendar, these areas will not be in use on our proposed night).

**Audio/Visual Needs:** Need an audio/visual person to run items in ProPresenter, music playlist, etc using the Youth Room sound/media system.
