Because the volunteer positions in youth ministry are highly relational, each volunteer will be mentored in a relational manner. It is difficult to quantify a relational ministry. Therefore, at regular intervals, each volunteer will meet with the Youth Pastor and be guided through a self-relfective process in the following areas: 
* How well they are meeting expectations of the job description.
* Are they showing up regularly to Pre-Ministry meetings, training, and actual ministry times?
* What are their current perceived strengths and weaknesses?
* Are they spending time regularly with the Lord? What does that look like?
* How do they perceive their ministry is going? 
	- what challenges are they experiencing?
	- What wins have they had? 
* How can I (the youth pastor) support them and pray for them?
