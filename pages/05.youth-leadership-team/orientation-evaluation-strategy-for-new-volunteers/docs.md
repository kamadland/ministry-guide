At Bethany Baptist Church, we recruit leaders by inviting those we know or observe to be a potentially good addition to our team as role models and disciplers of the students. 

It may take weeks or months to continue engaging with potential team members. I am always speaking with people about their gifts and how they might be able to serve the Body of Christ, especially in Student Ministries. If their gifts fit with Student Ministries, then the invitation is given. 

If an invitation is given to consider joining the Student Ministries team, and they accept, then the process below begins: 

**4 Step Plug-in Process for Student Ministries**
###### **1.	Observation**
Potential volunteers observe areas of ministry twice and are given an Observation Packet that includes job descriptions, a leader info package, and a leader application.
###### **2.	Interview** 
All potential volunteers will meet with the youth pastor and one other youth leader for a 30 minute interview to help determine their area of interest, the ministry's needs & expectations, and potential start date.
###### **3.	Training**
New volunteers are required to attend Leadership Training just before kick-off, as well as agree to the "terms of service" which include attending the Pre-Ministry Dinners/mini-training throughout the year.
###### **4.	Serve**
It's Go Time! After the previous three steps have been completed _and a background check has been passed_, they will begin serving in Student Ministry!

**Ongoing Training & Discipleship**
Once a leader has been approved and starts in Student Ministry, they are trained and discipled on a weekly basis. The leadership team functions as a small group--and one with purpose. All Student Ministries volunteers are expected to be at the pre-ministry meal where we break bread together. After that there is often mini-training sessions, a prayer time and last minute prep for the evening. After most events/meetings there is also a debrief/prayer time. 

**Evaluation**
New and ongoing volunteers will have evaluation time with the youth pastor. 
New volunteers will have an evaluation scheduled at 3 , 6 and 10 (end of the school year) months to see how they are doing, and how the youth pastor can help support them.
