## STUDENT MINISTRY VOLUNTEER PROCESS
![](http://BethanyLogo.png)

At Bethany Baptist Church, we recruit leaders by invited those we know or observe who would be a potentially good addition to our team and as role models and disciplers of the students. 

It may take weeks or months to continue engaging with potential team members. I am always speaking with people about their gifts and how they might be able to serve the Body of Christ. If their gifts fit with Student Ministries, then the invitation is given. 

If someone expresses interest in serving in Student Ministries then the process below begins: 


4 Step Plug-in Process:  Student Ministry Volunteer Process
1.	Observation
o	Observation  - Potential volunteers observe areas of ministry twice and are given an Observation packet that includes job descriptions, leader info package, and leader application.
2.	Interview 
o	Potential Volunteer Interview - All potential volunteers will meet with our youth pastor and one other youth leader for a 30 minute interview to help determine your area of interest, our needs, expectations, and potential start date.
3.	Training
o	New volunteers are required to attend Leadership Training just before kick-off.
4.	1st Serve
o	Go Time! - After the previous three steps have been completed and a background check has been passed, you will begin serving in Student Ministry!
Ongoing Training & Discipleship
Once a leader has been approved and starts in Student Ministry, they are trained and discipled on a weekly basis. The leadership team functions as a small group and one with purpose. All are expected to be at a pre-ministry meal where we break bread together. After that there is often mini-training sessions, a prayer time and last minute prep for the evening. After most events/meetings there is also a debrief/prayer time. 
Evaluation
New and ongoing volunteers will have evaluation time with the youth pastor. 
New volunteers will have an evaluation scheduled at 3 , 6 and 10 (end of the school year) months  to see how they are doing and how the youth pastor can help support them.
