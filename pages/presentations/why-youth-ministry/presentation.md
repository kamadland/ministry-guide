This presentation is for the class:
<ins>Thinking Theologically About Youth Ministry</ins>
<br>Professor: Rev. Dr. Chap Clark
<br>The Coalition for Youth Ministry Excellence
<br>July 10, 2020
<br>
<br>
Youth Ministry is a staple program in the modern Church, but have you ever thought about WHY it exists as a program? Just because something has always been done a certain way, doesn't necessarily mean it should continue. Hopefully, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will be constantly re-evaluating how we do church up and against God's Word. Is there a Biblical reason for providing youth ministry?

Jesus. That's it. Thank you for coming and have a great day.
<br>
<br>
But seriously, everything we DO at Bethany Student Ministries is aimed at pointing students to Jesus.

He is our centre...our reason for existing as a church and as a youth ministry. If he wasn't, we would simply be a community centre at best.

If Jesus is at the centre, this has implications for what we do. If that is the case, we should take a look at who he is. What is his heart?
<br> get into groups of 3-6
<br> Read the 2 passages on the slide and discuss the following question:
<br>
<br> What are the implications for youth ministry? (5-10 minutes)
<br>
<br> Come back and share highlights from each groups
<br> From John 1:12 draw out - we all have the right to be children of God/we are all part of one family.
<br>
<br> From Mark 10:13-16 draw out - Sometimes the church at large and also the rest of society hinders youth from being a part of the family of God - we see this with the Nones, Gones - youth and young adults who are leaving the church in droves. As a youth ministry we need to stop being part of the problem and start being a bridge into full acceptance into the family of God - the church. So what is our mission?
