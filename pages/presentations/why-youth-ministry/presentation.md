This presentation is for the class:
<ins>Thinking Theologically About Youth Ministry</ins>
<br>Professor: Rev. Dr. Chap Clark
<br>The Coalition for Youth Ministry Excellence
<br>July 10, 2020
<br>
<br>
Youth Ministry is a staple program in the modern Church, but have you ever thought about WHY it exists as a program? Just because something has always been done a certain way, doesn't necessarily mean it should continue. Hopefully, by the power of the Holy Spirit, we will be constantly re-evaluating how we do church up and against God's Word. Is there a Biblical reason for providing youth ministry?

Jesus. That's it. Thank you for coming and have a great day.
<br>
<br>
But seriously, everything we DO at Bethany Student Ministries is aimed at pointing students to Jesus.

He is our centre...our reason for existing as a church and as a youth ministry. If he wasn't, we would simply be a community centre at best.

[notes]
If Jesus is at the centre, this has implications for what we do. If that is the case, we should take a look at who he is. What is his heart?
<br> get into groups of 3-6
<br> Read the 2 passages on the slide and discuss the following question:
<br>
<br> What are the implications for youth ministry? (5-10 minutes)
<br>
<br> Come back and share highlights from each groups
<br> From John 1:12 draw out - we all have the right to be children of God/we are all part of one family.
<br>
<br> From Mark 10:13-16 draw out - Sometimes the church at large and also the rest of society hinders youth from being a part of the family of God - we see this with the Nones, Gones - youth and young adults who are leaving the church in droves. As a youth ministry we need to stop being part of the problem and start being a bridge into full acceptance into the family of God - the church.

[notes]
So what is our mission?
<br>
<br>
As we just read, anyone who believes and accepts Jesus is a child of God - so we are all his children and we are all part of his family, no matter what age.
<br> Therefore Youth Ministry is a part of the larger church, and we need to function, not as a silo unto ourselves, but as a bridge for students to be part of the whole. If that is the case, our mission should be the same as the whole church...and in fact, some youth leaders agreed upon this at the last visioning meeting.
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know the church's mission statement...which is our youth ministry mission statement as well?

What things are implied by this mission statement?
<br>
<br> draw out - Got's story offered to be ours (redemption).
<br> - Discipling - we journey together.
<br> the old has gone the NEW has come.
<br> etc.

[notes]
Groups of 3-6 to read and discuss the following questions:<br> How do you think these passages apply to Youth Ministry? <br> what is at stake? <br> What do you think is our responsibility/privilege as a child of God? <br> how does all of this fit or not fit with our mission statement? (5-10 minutes)
<br>
<br> Come back to large group & share highlights
<br> Draw out/ask
- can the illustration of the lost sheep apply to a group of people; ie, youth, black people? Why or why not? <br>
- our responsibility is to please the Lord - what things please the Lord? Can you use scripture to answer? (ie, helping rescue a lost sheep, cup of water, Micah 6:8, etc)
<br> Is youth ministry/ the goal of our mission statement a good thing that would please the Lord? Is this something you would love to stand before the Lord one day and show him you have done?

If our mission, then, is to disciple youth into a new story, we need a vision of how to do that.
<br>
<br>
In order to develop a vision of how to do youth ministry, we should learn a little bit about youth and what they are dealing with, and what they need. We can't make them believe in Jesus or heal them from hurts or make them choose good choices as well as involvement in church. But we can work towards learning who they are and what they need so we can create an environment that opens doors for those things to be able to happen. So what do the youth of today need?

Dr. Chap Clark suggests in his book Adoptive Church, that there are 3 tasks of adolescence:  
<br>
<ul>
1. Belonging  <br>        
2. Identity  <br>       
3. Autonomy  <br>    
</ul>
<br>
<br>
With belonging, adolescence want a place/community to belong that is bigger than themselves. This is so great because we can introduce God's Story to them - the overarching story of mankind and God's fight to redeem it is a story much bigger than each of them, and yet they are intimately a part of it and God has written a part specifically for them. Kids need to know that they are loved and supported beyond their own families - especially kids where their families are not a safe or supportive place.
<br>
<br> Identity is about figuring out who they are becoming and who they want to be. That is why it can seem they change from week to week. It is a time of experimentation and walking that journey. It is such a great time to help them know that their identity can be found in Christ as opposed to so many other things that vie for their allegiance.  
<br>
<br>Autonomy is about wanting a voice. They want increased control over their own lives. They are looking for and desiring increased independence and purpose. We have the ability in youth ministry to be able to help them with all of those things!
<br>
<br> In line with our mission statement and in response to these needs or tasks of adolescence,  our vision for youth ministry is as follows:

[notes]
(read the vision aloud)  <br>  
As you can see, the vision of how to do youth ministry, and who we aim to be, is borne out of the needs of adolescents from the previous slide. <br>  
Because they need to feel that they belong to something greater than themselves, we want to be *inviting*. Our church's vision uses the word "winning", but I feel that winning implies an agenda on our part. It comes from good intentions - we want to win souls for Christ. But our culture has changed and sometimes these old illustrations come to have different meanings. Winning also implies competition and achievement. Youth can smell inauthenticity and personal agendas a mile away. The bait and switch method of evangelism should be avoided at all costs. Kids need a place to belong, to be loved; a place of warmth and safety. The rest of the world is cold and they feel it is against them. We want youth group to be a place where they can be welcomed just as they are, welcomed with a smile, and a place where they can find community. Out of that will come the fun and a chance to BE the gospel to them and share it verbally with them out of the truth we are living.  <br>  
Because adolescents need to figure out who they are, we want to be a *nurturing* community. Bethany's vision statement says the word "equipping", but again, because the world is a different place for youth than it was 10 and 20 years ago or more, we need to change the nature of how we approach ministry. Equipping is part of nurturing, and we certainly want to continue with helping them engage with God's word, allowing them space to ask tough questions without judgment. We want to walk with them on their journeys through thick and thin by making small groups a central part of what we do. But we want to do this thoughtfully, and carefully, with warmth and real care and concern. This isn't just putting in time to earn brownie points with God. This is about real relationships, about being family - God's family.  <br>  
And finally, because adolescents need autonomy - a sense of power and worth, we want to be able to hand them the keys to that, so to speak. We want to be *empowering* in youth ministry. We want to help each student find and develop the gifts God has given them. This is done by mentoring via small groups, service opportunities inside and outside of church, as well as listening to their ideas and fanning their flame to implement them. The beauty of this is that it helps them figure out who they are as well as gives them a sense of belonging.  <br>

We need a strategy, then, for implementing our Mission and Vision for the church and for the youth ministry. How do we go about accomplishing these things?

[notes]
We want to create an environment where young people are encouraged to live into their calling in Christ as agents of the kingdom with the family of God.  <br>
<br>
For starters, We want a kid to be greeted with a smile and by name when they walk in the door. We want to aim for an overall ethos of warmth. Kids are arriving anxious about being accepted, about all the things going on at home, at school, etc. They need to sense they are wanted here and that they are safe.  <br>
<br>
Then we want to get to know them in small groups, build relationships and good memories: we want to share our lives with them so we can be there to listen, learn about them, and earn the right to speak into their lives.  <br>
<br>

Once again, get into groups of 3-6 and read and discuss the following questions in light of the scriptures on the slide:  
<br>  
<ul>  
1. What about this strategy to you agree with and what do you disagree with?  <br>
<br> 
2. As a youth leader/small group leader and in light of these scriptures, what do you see as your responsibility?  <br>  
</ul>
<br>
<br>
gather back in a large group and share highlights  <br>
<br>
Draw out - paul shared his life with the Thessalonians as a family member - and then had the right to speak into their lives because it was based on established trust and love.  <br>
