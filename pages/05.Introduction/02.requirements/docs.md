# Vision
**Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we seek to reach out to all kinds of students, winning, equipping, and empowering them for ministry.**

This is the same ministry vision as the rest of our church, with a couple of minor tweaks. The original is, "Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we seek to reach out cross-culturally, winning, equipping, and empowering people of ministry." 
We changed "cross-culturally" to "to all students". There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, we felt it needed to be student-specific since this was for student minitries. Secondly, we felt that "cross-culturally" was too narrow, and needed to expand to include other minority groups, such as those struggling with their identity, those who have disabilities, etc, _as well as cross-culturally_.

##### Winning
We want students to know they are loved, that they matter, and that they can have a new story because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We help them know this by creating a safe space where they can have fun at church, and also find community. We also hold events where we can share the gospel with them clearly and consisely.

##### Equipping 
For the believers, we have opportunities for them to regularly engage in God's word, as well as have all kinds of discussions without judgment - true & honest exploration. We create opportunities for them to serve and volunteer in church and on the street, so they can experience ministry with mentors who can help them understand the "why" behind what they are doing. We also want to walk with them through tough experiences and help them discover how they can grow through suffering if they allow God to show them.

##### Empowering for ministry
We want to help each student find and develop the gifts God has given them to build up his church. Part of that dovetails with mentoring students in and through ministry opportunities. We want to involve them in regular programming, and if they have ideas that work within the mission and vision of the ministry, we want to support them in that and fan the flame.

All of the above should be bathed in prayer and the seeking of guidance and wisdom from the Holy Spirit.
