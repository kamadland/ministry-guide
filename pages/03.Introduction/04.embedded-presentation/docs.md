Bethany Baptist was founded or planted in June 1937 by 38 members from the First German Baptist Church in Vancouver. By 1939, they had their first building on 47th Ave and Prince Albert Street in Vancouver, BC. All services were held in German. Serveral young men from Bethany serviced in WWII, but all came back safely. Soon after the war, many immigrants from Germany and the rest of Europe came to Vancouver, and Bethany was active in helping with post-war relief. By 1946, there was a youth group that was meeting. There is a picture in the 50th anniversary pictorial book of a group of 11 teens. By the mid-50's, Bethany had grown so much through immigration that they took up the challenge of dividing into about half and planting a new church, and Immanual Baptist Church was formed. 

Bethany Baptist Church experienced continued steady growth after WWII, and eventually they needed to build elsewhere. So in 1962, they moved into their newly completed building on Quebec Street and 50th Avenue in Vancouver. By the early 70's the Baby Boomers were in youth group, and Bethany called their first youth pastor part time in 1970. He was full time by 1972. At about the same time, the English service took precedence over the German service. A separate German-speaking service was held at 9 am and the English-speaking services were at 10 am and on Sunday evening.
