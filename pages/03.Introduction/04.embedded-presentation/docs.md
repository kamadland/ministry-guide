Bethany Baptist was founded or planted in June 1937 by 38 members from the First German Baptist Church in Vancouver. By 1939, they had their first building on 47th Ave and Prince Albert Street in Vancouver, BC. All services were held in German. Serveral young men from Bethany serviced in WWII, but all came back safely. Soon after the war, many immigrants from Germany and the rest of Europe came to Vancouver, and Bethany was active in helping with post-war relief. By 1946
