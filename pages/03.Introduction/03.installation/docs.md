Bethany Baptist Church is located in Richmond, BC which is a member municipality of Metro-Vancouver, Canada. The location of the church is at one end of the city of Richmond, but sitting almost on the boundary line of two other cities, and just off two different bridges that lead to four other cities within minutes. Describing, then, the demographics that make up our church provides quite a challenge.

Because the church is located in the City of Richmond, that puts us under their jurisdiction, it is who we pay taxed to, etc. Therefore, it is that city for which I will describe the demographics. Most of the people who attend the church from other cities have spread out over the years are connected historically. That will become evident in the next section on the demographics of the church
