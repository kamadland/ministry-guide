On Sunday, February 23, 2020, I had the privilege of meeting with my Student Ministries Team for an afternoon of internal auditing of the ministry, analysis and visiona and goal setting. There were 15 leaders in attendance covering the areas of our grade 6-7 ministry (iConnect), as well as our grade 8-12 ministry (Youth). We broke into groups to do the SWOT analysis, each group taking one area to brainstorm on. Then we met as a large group to hear each area presented and had a chance to offer feedback on each group's findings. The result is the SWOT analysis that follows.
