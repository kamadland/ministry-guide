On Sunday, February 23, 2020, I had the privilege of meeting with my Student Ministries Team for an afternoon of internal auditing of the ministry, analysis and visiona and goal setting. There were 15 leaders in attendance covering the areas of our grade 6-7 ministry (iConnect), as well as our grade 8-12 ministry (Youth). We broke into groups to do the SWOT analysis, each group taking one area to brainstorm on. Then we met as a large group to hear each area presented and had a chance to offer feedback on each group's findings. The result is the SWOT analysis that follows. 

### Strengths
* Enough Committed Leaders
* Committed Youth Band (made of student ministry members)
* Committed core group of kids that come
* A great facility and lots of space
* Lots of the leaders are young and the students can identify with them and mesh well with them.
* Lots of opportunities to serve in church
* Well funded
* Good location for diverse activities
* Our annual denominational May Camp (held on May long weekend - definitely a highlight that all the students want to attend).
* Our annual Clue game (a life-sized, church-wide version of the Clue game with different themes each year, held as a large outreach event)
* Strong connection with other churches (we are part of our city's network of youth groups called 604 Network and all meet several times a year. Also, May Camp is a joint effort of our provincial denominational youth groups). Students get a chance to see the larger Church at work.
* Bob - Bob is our 78-year-old youth leader who has served in Youth Ministry forever. The students love him and he rarely misses a week, or a school play, or a soccer game.
