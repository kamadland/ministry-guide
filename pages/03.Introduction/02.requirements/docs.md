2. The Bible as God's infallible Word, and its authority in all matters of faith and practice.
3. Fervent, authentic, Spirit-led worship of our sovereign triune God.
4. Prayer - realizing our total dependence on God and the work of the Holy Spirit.
5. Unity of purpose in the body of Christ.
6. The gifts of the Spirit given to every believer and their expression in ministry.
7. Commitment of every believer in service to Jesus Christ as seen in generous giving of time, energy and finances.
