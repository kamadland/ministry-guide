# Vision
**Through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we seek to reach out to all students, winning, equipping, and empowering people for ministry.**

This
We want students to know they are loved, that they matter, and that they can have a new story because of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. We help them know this by creating a safe space where they can have fun, and also engage in God's word as well as all kinds discussions without judgment - true & honest exploration.
