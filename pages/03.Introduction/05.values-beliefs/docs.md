At Bethany Student Ministries

**We believe we exist to enjoy and glorify God**
We love to have fun at Bethany Student Ministriess, but we have fun that is filled with purpose. We are not a ministry that runs events for the sake of simply occupying students. We run events to reflect God's love, to teach about him and to gloriy him, _while having fun._ We want our speech, our lives and how we love others to reflect God and be a witness for him. Therefore we will strive to have JOY - by putting Jesus first, others second and ourselves third. 

**We believe that everyone matters.**
Because every person is made in God's image, that means He knows who they are and He loves them. It means that He sent his son to die for them and see them as infinitely valuable. If he sees each person that way, then we need to see them that way. So regardless of size, age, colour, gender, body odor or odd behaviour, every person matters and needs to be treated with dignity. Every person should have the opportunity to hear about their Maker, how much he loves them, and to what extent he has already gone to reconnect with them. 

**We believe in being a safe space**
Because every student who walks through that door matters, we want them to feel safe and welcome. It needs to be a place they can call their own; a place where they want to return. Therefore, no bullying on social media or otherwise will be tolerated. This will be a space where confidentiality will be respected as long as by doing so does not put that student in danger or cause them harm. We want this to be a space where every student can ask tough questions about faith or otherwise, without fear of judgment or pat answers.
