At Bethany Baptist Church, we have extensive insurance coverage that is always open to adjustment as needed. I have discussed certain events with the staff member who oversees this, and he is able to help me find the correct waivers needed in special circumstances that deviate from our normal course of events. 

Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, he has temporarily been laid off, and I was unable to meet with him to get the information pertinent to this section.
