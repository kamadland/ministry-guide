These financials are from May Camp 2018. The only difference from year to year is inflation, and perhaps the cost of the band and sound rentals being higher or lower depending on who we are able to contract. Every 3 or 4 years we try to find an up and coming band, and pay a little more to have a group that is a bit more professional.
