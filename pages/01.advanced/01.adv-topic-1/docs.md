Educational/Professional Development

$5000 For The Coalition 

2-year program that would provide direct practicalities and support for youth ministry through Truth Matters and associated professors. Each year has 4 one-week intensives held at Green Bay that then feed into the youth program directly here for the following months. As well, as Spiritual mentor or companion meets weekly with the Youth Pastor to provide support and prayer. There is also a Spiritual Formation component of the program. (It can be part of an M.Div through several institutions if I pay for the credits.)
